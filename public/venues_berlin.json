Auch Sonderanfertigungen mit den eigenen Motiven sind natürlich kein Problem.Aber das ist nicht alles.Was auf Leinwand passt, passt auch auf Porzellan, Acryl, LKW-Plane, Karton, Stoff und Magnete. So finden sich die Motive von Sabine Welz inzwischen auch auf verschieden designten Produkten wie z. B. CITY-MUGS oder unikaten CITY-BAGS. So ist die Kunst nicht nur zu Hause an der Wand, sondern auch auf dem Tisch oder gar auf Reisen. Stetig wird das Konzept um neue Städte, Motive und Produkte erweitert, um alle Wände, Wohnungen und Büros dieser Welt farbenfroher und individueller zu machen.",
